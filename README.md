# PokeAPI-Project

Created a simple but pivotal milestone as a self taught developer by implementing the PokeAPI to display different pokemon in a card display with their characteristics.

Fetched data from an API to create HTML for each item created programmatically.
Built-in a function to add selected items from the array of Pokedata to a "favorites"

Built a toggle function that sorts the items in the collection and "favorites" list alphabetically (A-Z) and vice versa (Z-A).
Also displayed the total sum of poison type pokemon to practice pulling data from API arrays.

The website is also mobile responsive across desktop, ipad/tablet and mobile phones.


Enjoy!
